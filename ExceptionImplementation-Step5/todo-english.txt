TO DO:
1) Design Smell: Same issue with handler_not_found_strategy in UnhandleException
2) We have to evaluate the handler only if the exception type matches
3) Implement nested handlers
4) Test default_handler_not_found_strategy

Done:
- We should stop the execution after the message throw
- What should happened if no exception handler is found?
1) Design Smell: We should not use a class instance variable to reference the handler in Proc
   Same issue for return_closure
   Same issue with exception_to_handle_class
