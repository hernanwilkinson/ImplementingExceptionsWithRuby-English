TO DO:
1) Design Smell: We should not use a class instance variable to reference the handler in Proc
   Same issue for return_closure
2) We have to evaluate the handler only if the exception type matches

Done:
- We should stop the execution after the message throw
3) What should happened if no exception handler is found?
